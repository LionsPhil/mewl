Open source remake of a classic multiplayer economic strategy game.

This is something I was working on way back in 2009.
I said if I ran out of steam it would at least be open-source, so at least /one/ attempt at an accurate remake could be picked up and continue.
So here it is (finally); no promises on how useful it is or if I'll get back to it.
