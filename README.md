# M.E.W.L. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LionsPhil/mewl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LionsPhil/mewl)
Open source remake of the classic multiplayer economic strategy game [M.U.L.E.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.U.L.E.).

This is something I was working on way back in 2009, 2010.
[I said](http://bringerp.free.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?p=420#p420) if I ran out of steam it would at least be open-source, so at least _one_ attempt at an accurate remake could be picked up and continued.
So here it is (finally); no promises on how useful it is or if I'll get back to it.
