Mechanised Extraterrestial Work Labourer?

The internals use generic names, so that MULE-izing or please-dont-sue-izing is the responsibility of the UI.

The Wiimote D-pad is rotated 90 degrees between its pointing-at-screen and held-as-gamepad modes. Could be irritating, as not sure if "can't see screen" is a good enough test to trigger a rotate. Makes mixed-use IR and d-pad use awkward, too.

Species are an interesting modelling challenge:
 - The set can concievably be considered to be of flexible size; enum checks are
   nice, so is the factory-style adding of instances.
 - Factory is an ill-fit as instances of a species have no per-instance data.
   (Interface Species with a class for each actual species.)
 - The per-species data falls into two camps: logical (starting cash), and
   user interface (name, description, graphics). Neither is particularly
   priviledged over the other, and neither are instance state to keep
   consistent. Logic will only have one implementation; UI may have many.
 - A class Species with a static instance accessor (e.g. backed by a map)
   allows, say, logic to have accessor methods on each instance, but a different
   pattern must be used for UI (getdescription(species)).
 - A simple enum encodes the only information which is crucial to the species'
   consistency---which one it is---and then either data can be accessed by
   lookup tables. This does rather separate the species definition across
   multiple places, but that's inevitable as we allow for differing UIs; a
   simple struct record cannot know what information every UI may want.

Tuning variables which couldn't be determined from the original game have been marked with 'TWEAK' comments.

Sprite tiles are 64x64 and alpha-blend on top of the background. Top-left offset is 32 horizontal and 80 vertical. The mountain is smaller and has 16px horizontal and 4px vertical random wiggle within its subrow (of which there are four).
