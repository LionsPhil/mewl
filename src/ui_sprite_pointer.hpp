/** Dynamic sprite which renders as an appropriate pointer graphic.
 *
 * The pointer-*.png files (generated from SVG) are not raw graphics; they need
 * to be recoloured, which is what this class is for. The channel mapping is:
 *  Red   -> Player colour
 *  Green -> Border colour (white)
 *  Blue  -> Unused
 *  Alpha -> Alpha
 * We also need to generate the other directions by rotating the images.
 * The pointer hotspot is assumed to be in the dead centre, and rendering will
 * be offset to allow for this. */
